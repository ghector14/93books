                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    93books exists to make knowledge accessible. We believe that everyone deserves access to the wisdom 
                    contained in great books, but not everyone has the time to read hundreds of pages. Our detailed summaries 
                    capture the essential concepts, key insights, and actionable takeaways from each book, giving you the 
                    knowledge you need in a fraction of the time.

                <h2>The Story Behind 93books</h2>
                <p>
                    93books was created by Hector, a track and cross country coach with a deep love for running and reading. As a competitive runner, he understands the discipline of incremental progress—how small, consistent efforts compound into extraordinary results. That same philosophy applies to reading and learning.
                    <br><br>
                    Reading, for him, is like that iconic scene from The Matrix where Neo downloads martial arts directly into his brain. "I know Kung Fu." That's the power of books, you can download decades of someone's experience, research, and wisdom in just hours. 93books exists to make that download even faster, distilling complex ideas into clear, actionable summaries so you can absorb knowledge at the speed of thought.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The name "93" represents the pursuit of excellence and the belief that consistent effort leads to 
                    extraordinary results, much like the incremental progress made through reading and learning.
